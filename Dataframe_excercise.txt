START: 
Write a R program to create a data frame from five given vectors.
## Names     Age Height Weight Sex
## IronMan    42    157     65   M
## Hawkeye    32    167     54   M
## Hulk       36    175     72   M
## Blackwidow 24    188     55   F
## Wasp       36    168     68   F
## Thanos     43    153     120  M
## Okoye      32    173     59   F
## Thor       33    167     63   M
## Antman     29    165     65   M
## DrStrange  43    167     69   M
a. Find the dimension of the dataframe.
b. What is the class of Names and Sex ?
c. Try converting them to charcters.
d. What are the means of Age Height and weight columns.
e. Check your results by using the command `summary(dataframe)`.
f. Subset the datframe to make another dataframe with Name, Height and Sex.
g. Select Name as dataframe and vector using all the possible ways.
h. count the number of F and M in the data frame.
Add another individual: Vison, NA,175,77,M
i. Add another column to dataframe with their humor levels as:  
`good, average,average,excellent,good,poor,good,good,Average,Average`
  1. New dataframe with fitness humor as charachter vector.
  2. New dataframe with fitness humor as factor as levels.
j. Make names to rownames
k. Subset dataframe with first 4 rows.
l. Subset dataframe with column 1,2,3,5 and rows 3,4,5,7


Add this new information in form of dataframe to the old dataframe (above) such that
## Names     employmentStatus 
## Ironman        Yes    
## Hawkeye        Yes  
## WinterSoldier  No
## Wasp           No
## Blackwdow      Yes
## Thanos         No
## CaptAmerica    No
## Blackpanther   No
## Falcon         Yes
## okoye          Yes

1. the new dataframe has only the common observations.
2. the new dataframe all the observations of old dataframe but no new observations of new dataframe.
3. the new dataframe all the observations of new dataframe but no additional observations of old dataframe..
4. the new dataframe has all the observations of old and new dataframe.
