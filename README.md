# Introduction to R for Biologists

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial designed specifically for biologists venturing into the world of R, a powerful and versatile programming language that has become indispensable in modern biological research. The lecture material is still under development and new material will be added on regular intervals.

## Why R for Biologists?

As a biologist, you're continually faced with the challenge of analyzing complex datasets, from genomic sequences to ecological observations. R, with its extensive range of packages and functions, is tailored to meet these challenges, providing tools for statistical analysis, data visualization, and even bioinformatics.

In this tutorial, we will embark on a journey to unlock the potential of R in the field of biology. Whether you're examining gene expression data, modeling population dynamics, or deciphering the complexities of ecosystems, R is the toolkit that can bring your data to life.

## What You Will Learn

1. **Getting Started with R**: We'll begin with the basics - installing R and familiarizing yourself with the RStudio environment.
   
2. **Fundamentals of R Programming**: You'll learn the essentials of R programming, including data types, variables, and basic functions.
   
3. **Data Manipulation and Analysis in R**: Dive into how to manipulate and analyze biological datasets using R packages like dplyr and tidyr.
   
4. **Statistical Analysis in Biology**: Understand how to apply statistical methods in R to draw meaningful conclusions from your data.
   
5. **Creating Compelling Visualizations**: Learn how to use ggplot2 to create informative and attractive visualizations of your biological data.
   
6. **Bioinformatics with R**: Explore how R can be used for bioinformatics applications, including sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies.

7. **Case Studies and Practical Examples**: Apply what you've learned in real-world biological scenarios, reinforcing concepts and techniques with practical applications.
